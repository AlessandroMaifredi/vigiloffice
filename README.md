## Description

VigilOffice is an innovative IoT project developed as part of a university course. It aims to streamline office management through the utilization of three distinct types of nodes. These nodes offer advanced functionalities to enhance lighting control, environmental comfort, and parking management within office spaces.

The first node type focuses on lighting control and also serves as a flame detector. When enabled, it integrates an anti-intrusion system, providing an all-in-one solution for office security.

The second node type is designed to enhance environmental comfort by managing ventilation. Equipped with flame detection capabilities, it can also automatically maintain a constant temperature, ensuring optimal working conditions.

The third node type revolutionizes office parking management. It features a flame sensor and enables parking reservations through a dedicated Telegram bot. This integration allows for efficient and convenient parking management within the office premises.

At the core of VigilOffice is a robust server built with Serverpod technology. This server maintains an up-to-date database of all node data, ensuring real-time monitoring and control. It offers three types of APIs to facilitate diverse interactions:

1. Simple JSON API: This API enables machine-to-machine communication and provides a straightforward interface for accessing and manipulating nodes.
2. WoT JSON-LD API: This API utilizes the Web of Things (WoT) vocabulary to enhance machine-to-machine communication. It enables seamless integration with other IoT devices and systems. **It is a read-only API.**
3. Graphical User Interface (UI): The UI provides a user-friendly interface for human users to interact with the VigilOffice system. It offers intuitive controls and visualizations for easy monitoring and management.

Additionally, the server supports dynamic MQTT topic configuration, allowing for flexible and customizable node communication. This feature ensures efficient and reliable data exchange between the nodes and the server.

To further enhance user experience, VigilOffice offers a Telegram bot, accessible at [VigilOfficeBot](https://t.me/VigilOfficeBot). This bot provides real-time information about the system's nodes and offers convenient commands for managing parking reservations.

VigilOffice represents a cutting-edge solution for office management, combining advanced IoT technologies, secure communication protocols, and user-friendly interfaces to optimize efficiency and convenience in the modern workplace.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into several folders:

- **Presentation**: This folder includes all the project documentation and presentation materials.
- **NODES**
  - **/lampNode**: Contains the code for the lamp node.
  - **/hvacNode**: Contains the code for the hvac node.
  - **/parkingNode**:  Contains the code for the parking node.
- **/VigilOffice**: This folder contains the Serverpod code and includes JSON files used as templates for communication.
  - **/VigilOffice_client**: This folder contains the code generated by Serverpod for the client application used to communicate with the server.
  - **/VigilOffice_flutter**: This folder contains the code for a multi-platform client application, but it is currently not being used in the project.
  - **/VigilOffice_server**: This folder contains the code for the VigilOffice server. Please refer to the README file in the folder for detailed instructions on how to run the server.

## API

The server offers three types of APIs: two for machine-to-machine communication and one for the graphical user interface.

*All apis can be reached at port 8082*.

The paths are:

- Simple JSON API: **/api/v1** [View on Swagger HUB](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/AlessandroMaifredi/VigilOffice/1.0.0-oas3.1)
- WoT JSONLD API: **/api/wot/v1/**
- UI: **/**

*The Web of Things (WoT) API follows the same paths as the Simple JSON API.*

Both in the APIs and the UI, there is a distinction between a "Device" and a "Node status". A "Device" is a simplified representation of a node, consisting only of its type and connection status. On the other hand, the node status represents the actual state of the node, including all the current values from its sensors.

## Telegram bot

VigilOffice offers a Telegram bot, accessible at [VigilOfficeBot](https://t.me/VigilOfficeBot), which allows users to access real-time information about the system's nodes. Additionally, the bot provides commands for managing parking reservations.
